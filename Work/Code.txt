1. Introduction to Topic Modeling

    What is Topic Modeling?
        Simple Definition: "Topic modeling is a machine learning technique that automatically discovers the themes or topics present in a collection of documents."
        Real-World Example: "Imagine you have a huge stack of customer feedback forms. Topic modeling helps you quickly identify the key themes customers are talking about, such as product quality, customer service, or pricing."

2. Introducing LDA

    What is LDA?
        Simple Definition: "LDA is a popular algorithm for topic modeling. It stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation."
        Core Idea: "LDA assumes that each document (like a customer feedback form or an email) is made up of multiple topics, and each topic is made up of words. LDA figures out the mixture of topics within each document and the most important words for each topic."

3. How LDA Works (High-Level Overview)

    Documents as Mixtures of Topics:
        Example: "A customer review might mostly talk about product quality (Topic A) and a little bit about delivery service (Topic B). LDA can identify that mix."
    Topics as Mixtures of Words:
        Example: "The 'Product Quality' topic might frequently include words like 'durable,' 'reliable,' and 'quality.' LDA finds these words that are important to each topic.
